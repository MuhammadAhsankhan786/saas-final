# Middleware Fix - Final Resolution

## Issue
**Error**: `Target class [role] does not exist`  
**Location**: Kernel.php line 257 in terminateMiddleware

## Root Cause
The `RoleMiddleware` had an empty `terminate()` method that was being incorrectly invoked by Laravel's middleware termination system. Laravel was trying to resolve 'role' as a class instead of using the registered middleware alias.

## Solution
**Removed the `terminate()` method** from `RoleMiddleware.php`

## File Changes

### Before:
```php
public function terminate($request, $response)
{
    // No termination logic needed
}
```

### After:
```php
// Terminate method removed
```

## What This Fixed
- Laravel no longer tries to resolve 'role' as a class during termination
- Middleware properly registers as 'role' alias
- Routes using `middleware('role:client')` now work correctly
- All role-based access control functional

## Verified Status
- ✅ Server restarted with new configuration
- ✅ Cache cleared
- ✅ All routes accessible
- ✅ Role-based access working

## System Status: **FIXED** ✅

The appointment booking system is now fully operational.
