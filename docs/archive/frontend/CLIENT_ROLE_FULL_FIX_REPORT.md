- `update()` - ‚ú® FIXED: Added missing route
- `destroy()` - Enforces ownership check

‚úÖ **ConsentFormController**:
- `index()` - Filters by client_id
- `store()` - Forces client_id to logged-in client
- `update()` - Ownership validation
- `destroy()` - Ownership validation

‚úÖ **PaymentController**:
- `myPayments()` - Returns client-specific payments
- ‚ú® FIXED: PackageController.myPackages() now properly queries by client record

‚úÖ **PackageController**:

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ DIAGNOSE & FIX

### Issues Fixed

#### Issue 1: Missing Client Appointment Update Route
**Error**: 404 Not Found when client tries to update appointment  
**Fix**: Added `Route::put('appointments/{appointment}', [AppointmentController::class, 'update'])` in client route group  
**File**: `routes/api.php` line 180

#### Issue 2: PackageController.myPackages() Query Error
**Error**: Packages not returned for clients  
**Fix**: Changed query from `where('client_id', $user->id)` to properly query Client model first, then ClientPackage  
**File**: `app/Http/Controllers/PackageController.php` lines 47-63

#### Issue 3: Location Model Missing Fillable Fields
**Error**: 500 Internal Server Error for /admin/locations  
**Fix**: Added `city`, `state`, `zip_code`, `zip` to fillable array  
**File**: `app/Models/Location.php`

#### Issue 4: Client Model Packages Relationship
**Error**: Incomplete belongsToMany relationship  
**Fix**: Added explicit column names and pivot attributes  
**File**: `app/Models/Client.php` lines 65-70

#### Issue 5: Duplicate Client Package Entries
**Error**: Unique constraint violation during seeding  
**Fix**: Added existence checks before inserting  
**File**: `database/seeders/ClientDataSeeder.php`

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ TEST APIs

### Database Seeding Results

‚úÖ **Created Data**:
- Client Profile: ID 1
- 3 Appointments:
  - Past (5 days ago) - Completed
  - Today - Confirmed
  - Future (7 days) - Booked
- 2 Payments:
  - $150.00 (Completed, 5 days ago)
  - $85.00 (Pending, today)
- 2 Packages Assigned:
  - Premium Facial Package ($500)
  - Beauty Essentials ($250)
- 2 Consent Forms:
  - Consent form (10 days ago)
  - Intake form (5 days ago)

### Endpoint Testing Status

| Endpoint | Method | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|--------|-------|
| `/api/client/appointments` | GET | ‚úÖ 200 | Returns 3 appointments |
| `/api/client/payments` | GET | ‚úÖ 200 | Returns 2 payments |
| `/api/client/packages` | GET | ‚úÖ 200 | Returns 2 assigned packages |
| `/api/client/consent-forms` | GET | ‚úÖ 200 | Returns 2 consent forms |
| `/api/client/me` | GET | ‚úÖ 200 | Returns client profile |
| `/api/client/appointments/{id}` | PUT | ‚úÖ 200 | Update working |

---

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ FRONTEND FIX & SYNC

### Components Updated

#### Appointment List (`appointment-list.js`)
‚úÖ Already uses correct API:
- Admin: `/admin/appointments`
- Client: `/client/appointments` via `getMyAppointments()`

#### API Functions (`api.js`)
‚úÖ Client-specific functions verified:
- `getMyAppointments()` - Uses `/client/appointments`
- `getMyPayments()` - Uses `/client/payments`
- `getMyPackages()` - Uses `/client/packages`
- `createAppointment()` - Uses `/client/appointments`
- `deleteAppointment()` - Uses `/client/appointments/{id}`

### Client Dashboard Status

‚ö†Ô∏è **Needs Update**: `client-dashboard.js` currently uses mock data  
**Recommendation**: Update to use real API calls (see TODO below)

---

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ VALIDATION PHASE

### Role Isolation Tests

‚úÖ **JWT Authentication**: Working  
‚úÖ **Role Middleware**: Validated  
‚úÖ **Data Ownership**: All queries filter by client_id  
‚úÖ **403 Unauthorized**: Properly returned for cross-client access

### Security Checks

| Test Case | Status | Result |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| Client cannot access admin endpoints | ‚úÖ PASS | Returns 403 |
| Client can only see own appointments | ‚úÖ PASS | Filtered correctly |
| Client can only see own payments | ‚úÖ PASS | Filtered correctly |
| Client can only see own packages | ‚úÖ PASS | Filtered correctly |
| Client cannot modify other client data | ‚úÖ PASS | 403 returned |

---

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ SECURITY CHECK

### Access Control

‚úÖ **Authentication**: JWT middleware enforced on all client routes  
‚úÖ **Authorization**: Role middleware validates client role  
‚úÖ **Data Isolation**: All queries use `where('client_id', $client->id)`  
‚úÖ **Ownership Verification**: Controllers check client_id before operations

### Middleware Stack

```php
Route::prefix('client')->middleware('auth:api')->group(function () {
    // All client routes protected by JWT auth
});
```

Controllers enforce:
- `$user->role === 'client'`
- `Client::where('user_id', $user->id)->first()`
- `$appointment->client_id === $client->id`
