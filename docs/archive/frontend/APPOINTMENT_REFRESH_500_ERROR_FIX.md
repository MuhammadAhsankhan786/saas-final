# Appointment Refresh 500 Error Fix Report

**Date:** 2025-01-27  
**Issue:** 500 Internal Server Error when refreshing appointments after deleting as client  
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED

---

## Problem

After deleting an appointment as a client, refreshing the appointments list resulted in a 500 error:

```
❌ API call failed: 500 Internal Server Error for /admin/appointments
```

The error occurred because the `appointment-list.js` component was using the admin endpoint (`getAppointments()`) for ALL users, including clients.

---

## Root Cause

The `appointment-list.js` component had multiple hardcoded calls to `getAppointments()` (admin endpoint) in:
1. Status update handler - `handleStatusChange()`
2. Refresh handler - `handleRefreshAppointments()`
3. Delete handler - `handleDeleteAppointment()`

Even though the initial fetch was correctly role-based:
```javascript
const data = isAdmin 
  ? await getAppointments()     // Admin endpoint
  : await getMyAppointments();  // Client/Provider endpoint
```

The subsequent refresh operations were all using the admin endpoint.

---

## Solution Implemented

### File: `medspafrontend/src/components/appointments/appointment-list.js`

Updated all three handlers to use role-based endpoint selection:

#### 1. **Status Update Handler** (Lines 167-181)

**Before:**
```javascript
try {
  await updateAppointmentStatus(appointmentId, newStatus);
  const data = await getAppointments();  // ❌ Always admin endpoint
  const formattedAppointments = data.map(formatAppointmentForDisplay);
  setAppointments(formattedAppointments);
  notify.success(`Appointment status updated to ${newStatus}`);
}
```

**After:**
```javascript
try {
  await updateAppointmentStatus(appointmentId, newStatus);
 Centralized_role-based endpoint selection
  const data = isAdmin 
    ? await getAppointments()     // ✅ Admin endpoint
    : await getMyAppointments();  // ✅ Client/Provider endpoint
  const formattedAppointments = Array.isArray(data) 
    ? data.map(formatAppointmentForDisplay)
    : [];
  setAppointments(formattedAppointments);
  notify.success(`Appointment status updated to ${newStatus}`);
}
```

#### 2. **Refresh Handler** (Lines 185-199)

**Before:**
```javascript
const handleRefreshAppointments = async () => {
  try {
    const data = await getAppointments();  // ❌ Always admin endpoint
    const formattedAppointments = data.map(formatAppointmentForDisplay);
    setAppointments(formattedAppointments);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error refreshing appointments:", error);
  }
};
```

**After:**
```javascript
const handleRefreshAppointments = async () => {
  try {
    // Use role-based endpoint
    const data = isAdmin 
      ? await getAppointments()     // ✅ Admin endpoint
      : await getMyAppointments();  // ✅ Client/Provider endpoint
    const formattedAppointments = Array.isArray(data) 
      ? data.map(formatAppointmentForDisplay)
      : [];
    setAppointments(formattedAppointments);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error refreshing appointments:", error);
    notify.error("Failed to refresh appointments");
  }
};
```

#### 3. **Delete Handler** (Lines 213-229)

**Before:**
```javascript
if (confirmed) {
  try {
    await deleteAppointment(appointmentId);
    const data = await getAppointments();  // ❌ Always admin endpoint
    const formattedAppointments = data.map(formatAppointmentForDisplay);
    setAppointments(formattedAppointments);
    notify.success("Appointment deleted successfully");
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error deleting appointment:", error);
  }
}
```

**After:**
```javascript
if (confirmed) {
  try {
    await deleteAppointment(appointmentId);
    // Refresh appointments list using role-based endpoint
    const data = isAdmin 
      ? await getAppointments()     // ✅ Admin endpoint
      : await getMyAppointments();  // ✅ Client/Provider endpoint
    const formattedAppointments = Array.isArray(data) 
      ? data.map(formatAppointmentForDisplay)
      : [];
    setAppointments(formattedAppointments);
    notify.success("Appointment deleted successfully");
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error deleting appointment:", error);
    notify.error("Failed to delete appointment: " + error.message);
  }
}
```

## Improvements

### 1. Role-Based Endpoint Selection
All refresh operations now respect the user's role:
- **Admin**: `/api/admin/appointments`
- **Client**: `/api/client/appointments` (via `getMyAppointments()`)
- **Provider/Reception**: `/api/staff/appointments` (via `getMyAppointments()`)

### 2. Array Safety
Added explicit array checking before mapping to prevent errors on non-array responses:
```javascript
const formattedAppointments = Array.isArray(data) 
  ? data.map(formatAppointmentForDisplay)
  : [];
```

### 3. Error Notifications
Added toast error notifications for failed operations:
- `notify.error("Failed to refresh appointments")`
- `notify.error("Failed to delete appointment: " + error.message)`

## Testing Verification

### Test Scenario: Client Deletes Appointment
1. **Login as client** → Navigate to Appointments List
2. **Click Delete** on an appointment → Confirm
3. **After deletion** → Appointments list refreshes using `/api/client/appointments`
4. **Result**: ✅ No 500 error, list updates correctly

### Test Scenario: Admin Refreshes Appointments
1. **Login as admin** → Navigate to Appointments List
2. **Click Refresh** button
3. **Appointments refresh** using `/api/admin/appointments`
4. **Result**: ✅ No errors, all appointments displayed

---

## Security Compliance

✅ **RBAC**: Each role uses appropriate endpoint  
✅ **Data Isolation**: Clients only see their own appointments  
✅ **JWT Auth**: All endpoints protected with authentication  
✅ **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback on API failures

## Files Changed

1. **`medspafrontend/src/components/appointments/appointment-list.js`** (Lines 167-229)
   - Updated status update handler to use role-based endpoint
   - Updated refresh handler to use role-based endpoint
   - Updated delete handler to use role-based endpoint
   - Added array safety checks and error notifications

## Status

✅ **RESOLVED** - All appointment refresh operations now use role-appropriate endpoints, preventing 500 errors for client users.
