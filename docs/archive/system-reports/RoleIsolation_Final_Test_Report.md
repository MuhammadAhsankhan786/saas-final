**Result:** ✅ PASS  
**Details:** JWT authentication working correctly. Token validation on every API call.

### 5.4 Backend Middleware Enforcement

**Middleware Stack:**
1. `auth:api` → Verifies JWT token
2. `role:admin,provider` → Verifies user role

**Verified in routes/api.php:**
```php
Route::middleware(['auth:api', 'role:admin'])->prefix('admin')->group(function () {
    // Admin-only routes
});
```

**Result:** ✅ PASS

## 8. Known Issues & Recommendations

### 8.1 Minor Issues

**Issue 1:** API Endpoint Selection
- **Description:** Some frontend components call `/api/admin/*` for all roles
- **Impact:** Low (Backend middleware handles authorization correctly)
- **Recommendation:** Create role-aware API endpoint selection
- **Status:** ⚠️ Not Critical

**Issue 2:** Client Appointment Endpoint
- **Description:** Using `getMyAppointments()` which calls `/api/client/appointments`
- **Status:** ✅ Correct for client role, but admin/staff should use appropriate endpoints
- **Impact:** Low
- **Recommendation:** Add role-based API endpoint selection

### 8.2 Future Enhancements

1. **Automated E2E Testing**
   - Implement Cypress or Playwright tests
   - Test each role's full workflow
   - Automate database verification

2. **Role-Based API Endpoint Selection**
   - Create helper function to select endpoint based on role
   - Example: `getEndpoint('appointments', user.role)`

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Lazy load role-based components
   - Cache role permissions
   - Optimize API calls per role

4. **Security Enhancements**
   - Add rate limiting per role
   - Implement activity logging
   - Add suspicious activity detection
