## 🔧 Issues Fixed

### Issue #1: 404 Errors on Navigation

**Root Cause:**
- Sidebar was using Next.js `Link` components with `href` attributes
- Application uses client-side state management (`currentPage`) instead of Next.js file-based routing
- This caused Next.js to try to navigate to non-existent routes, resulting in 404 errors

**Fix Applied:**
```javascript
// BEFORE: Using Next.js Link components
<Link href={itemPath}>
  <Button onClick={() => onPageChange(item.id)}>
    {item.label}
  </Button>
</Link>

// AFTER: Pure client-side navigation
<Button onClick={() => onPageChange(item.id)}>
  {item.label}
</Button>
```

**Files Modified:**
1. `medspafrontend/src/components/layout/sidebar.js`
   - Removed `Link` import from `next/link`
   - Removed `usePathname` import
   - Removed `getBasePath()` and `getItemPath()` functions
   - Changed from `Link` wrapped buttons to pure `Button` components
   - Navigation now works purely via `onPageChange()` callback

**Result:** ✅ No more 404 errors. Navigation works smoothly via client-side state.
