## 🛠️ Implementation Details

### Backend Changes (Laravel)

#### 1. **Routes Configuration** (`routes/api.php`)

**Enhanced Client Routes with Profile Management:**
```php
Route::prefix('client')->middleware('auth:api')->group(function () {
    // Profile management
    Route::get('me/profile', [ProfileController::class, 'getProfile']);
    Route::put('me/profile', [ProfileController::class, 'updateProfile']);
    Route::post('me/profile/photo', [ProfileController::class, 'uploadProfilePhoto']);
    Route::delete('me/profile/photo', [ProfileController::class, 'deleteProfilePhoto']);

    // Appointments
    Route::get('appointments', [AppointmentController::class, 'myAppointments']);
    Route::post('appointments', [AppointmentController::class, 'store']);
    Route::get('appointments/{appointment}', [AppointmentController::class, 'show']);
    Route::delete('appointments/{appointment}', [AppointmentController::class, 'destroy']);

    // Consent Forms
    Route::apiResource('consent-forms', ConsentFormController::class)->only([
        'index', 'store', 'show', 'update', 'destroy'
    ]);

    // Treatments (view own only)
    Route::apiResource('treatments', TreatmentController::class)->only([
        'index', 'show'
    ]);

    // Payments
    Route::get('payments', [PaymentController::class, 'myPayments']);
    Route::post('payments', [PaymentController::class, 'store']);
    Route::post('payments/{payment}/confirm-stripe', [PaymentController::class, 'confirmStripePayment']);
    Route::get('payments/{payment}/receipt', [PaymentController::class, 'generateReceipt']);

    // Packages
    Route::get('packages', [PackageController::class, 'myPackages']);
});
```

#### 2. **ConsentFormController Updates** (`app/Http/Controllers/ConsentFormController.php`)

**Added Strict Ownership Validation:**

**Store Method:**
```php
public function store(Request $request)
{
    $user = auth()->user();
    
    // Client can only create consent forms for themselves
    if ($user->role === 'client') {
        $client = \App\Models\Client::where('user_id', $user->id)->first();
        if (!$client) {
            return response()->json(['message' => 'Client profile not found'], 404);
        }
        // Force client_id to be the logged-in client's ID
        $request->merge(['client_id' => $client->id]);
    }
    
    // ... validation and creation
}
```

**Update Method:**
```php
public function update(Request $request, string $id)
{
    $consentForm = ConsentForm::findOrFail($id);
    $user = auth()->user();

    // Client can only update their own consent forms
    if ($user->role === 'client') {
        $client = \App\Models\Client::where('user_id', $user->id)->first();
        if (!$client || $consentForm->client_id !== $client->id) {
            return response()->json(['message' => 'Unauthorized'], 403);
        }
    }
    // ... update logic
}
```

**Destroy Method:**
```php
public function destroy(string $id)
{
    $consentForm = ConsentForm::findOrFail($id);
    $user = auth()->user();

    // Client can only delete their own consent forms
    if ($user->role === 'client') {
        $client = \App\Models\Client::where('user_id', $user->id)->first();
        if (!$client || $consentForm->client_id !== $client->id) {
            return response()->json(['message' => 'Unauthorized'], 403);
        }
    }
    // ... delete logic
}
```

#### 3. **AppointmentController** (Already Implemented)

**Existing Ownership Validation:**
- `myAppointments()` - Filters by logged-in client's ID
- `show()` - Returns 403 if attempting to access another client's appointment
- `store()` - Only allows client role to create
- `destroy()` - Returns 403 if attempting to delete another client's appointment

#### 4. **PaymentController** (Already Implemented)

**Existing Ownership Validation:**
- `myPayments()` - Returns only logged-in client's payments
- Client_id automatically filtered by user->id

#### 5. **PackageController** (Already Implemented)

**Existing Ownership Validation:**
- `myPackages()` - Returns only logged-in client's assigned packages
- Filters by client_id = user->id

---

### Frontend Changes (Next.js/React)

#### 1. **Sidebar Navigation Filter** (`medspafrontend/src/components/layout/sidebar.js`)

**Added Client Role Filtering:**
```javascript
// Client role UI isolation: show only self-service modules
if (user.role === "client") {
    const allowedTopLevel = new Set([
        "dashboard",
        "appointments",
        "payments",
        "settings",
    ]);

    const allowedChildrenByParent = {
        // Appointments: Book and view own only (no calendar)
        "appointments": new Set(["appointments/book"]),
        // Payments: View own payment history
        "payments": new Set(["payments/history", "payments/packages"]),
        // Settings: Profile only
        "settings": new Set(["settings/profile"]),
    };

    filteredNavItems = navigationItems
        .filter((item) => allowedTopLevel.has(item.id))
        .map((item) => {
            const allowedChildren = allowedChildrenByParent[item.id];
            const children = Array.isArray(item.children) ? item.children : [];
            const prunedChildren = allowedChildren
                ? children.filter((child) => allowedChildren.has(child.id))
                : [];
            return { ...item, children: prunedChildren };
        });
}
```

#### 2. **Visible vs Hidden Modules**

**✅ Visible for Client:**
- Dashboard (own summary)
- Appointments → Book Appointment
- Payments → History, Packages
- Settings → Profile

**🚫 Hidden for Client:**
- Clients List
- Calendar View
- Inventory
- Reports
- Staff Management
- Business Settings
- Compliance/Audit
- POS/Billing
- Treatments (own treatments accessible via direct API only)

## 🔒 Security Measures

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
1. **JWT Authentication**: All client routes protected by `auth:api` middleware
2. **Ownership Validation**: Every query filters by `client_id = user->id`
3. **Forced Client ID**: When creating records, client_id is automatically set to logged-in client's ID
4. **403 Forbidden**: Proper HTTP status codes returned for unauthorized access

### Data Isolation
- **Appointments**: Filtered by `client_id` matching logged-in user's client profile
- **Consent Forms**: Filtered and validated by `client_id`
- **Payments**: Filtered by logged-in client's ID
- **Packages**: Assigned packages only for logged-in client
- **Treatments**: View-only, filtered by appointment ownership

### Cross-Data Prevention
- ✅ Client cannot view other clients' appointments
- ✅ Client cannot access other clients' consent forms
- ✅ Client cannot view other clients' payments
- ✅ Client cannot create consent forms for other clients
- ✅ All `client_id` values automatically enforced

---

## 📊 Database Schema

No database schema changes were required. Client uses existing tables:
- `users` - For client login and profile
- `clients` - Links user_id to client profile
- `appointments` - Client appointments with client_id
- `consent_forms` - Client consent forms with client_id
- `payments` - Client payments with client_id
- `client_packages` - Client package assignments
- `treatments` - View-only, linked via appointments

**Relationships:**
- `users.id` → `clients.user_id`
- `clients.id` → `appointments.client_id`
- `clients.id` → `consent_forms.client_id`
- `clients.id` → `payments.client_id`
