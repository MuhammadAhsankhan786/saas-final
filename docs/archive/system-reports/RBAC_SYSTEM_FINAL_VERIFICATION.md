## 🔍 Backend Route Analysis

### Route Prefixes by Role

#### 1️⃣ **Admin Routes** (`/api/admin/*`)
**Middleware**: `auth:api` + `admin.readonly`
**Access Level**: READ-ONLY (GET only)

| Endpoint | Method | Controller | Status |
|----------|--------|------------|--------|
| `/appointments` | GET | AppointmentController::index | ✅ |
| `/appointments/{id}` | GET | AppointmentController::show | ✅ |
| `/users` | GET | AdminUserController::index | ✅ |
| `/clients` | GET | ClientController::index | ✅ |
| `/clients/{id}` | GET | ClientController::show | ✅ |
| `/payments` | GET | PaymentController::index | ✅ |
| `/payments/{id}` | GET | PaymentController::show | ✅ |
| `/packages` | GET | PackageController::index | ✅ |
| `/services` | GET | ServiceController::index | ✅ |
| `/products` | GET | ProductController::index | ✅ |
| `/reports/*` | GET | ReportsController | ✅ |
| `/audit-logs` | GET | AuditLogController | ✅ |
| `/compliance-alerts` | GET | ComplianceAlertController | ✅ |
| `/locations` | GET | LocationController | ✅ |

**Security Check**: ✅ AdminReadOnlyMiddleware blocks POST/PUT/DELETE (returns 403)

#### 2️⃣ **Staff Routes** (`/api/staff/*`)
**Middleware**: `auth:api` + `role:provider,reception`
**Access Level**: CRUD (Provider = own data, Reception = full CRUD)

| Module | Provider Access | Reception Access | Endpoints |
|--------|----------------|------------------|-----------|
| **Clients** | View Only | Full CRUD | GET/POST/PUT/DELETE |
| **Appointments** | View/Update (own) | Full CRUD | GET/POST/PUT/DELETE/PATCH |
| **Consent Forms** | CRUD (own clients) | View | Full CRUD |
| **Treatments** | CRUD (own) | No Access | Full CRUD |
| **Payments** | View Only | Create/View | GET/POST |
| **Packages** | View Only | View Only | GET/SHOW |
| **Services** | View Only | View Only | GET/SHOW |
| **Inventory** | View Only | View Only | GET/SHOW |
| **Stock Notifications** | View Only | View Only | GET |

**Security Check**: ✅ ClientController overdue, update, destroy enforce role-based guards

#### 3️⃣ **Client Routes** (`/api/client/*`)
**Middleware**: `auth:菁` (all authenticated users)
**Access Level**: SELF-SERVICE ONLY (own data)

| Endpoint | Method | Controller | Ownership | Status |
|----------|--------|------------|-----------|--------|
| `/me/profile` | GET/PUT | ProfileController | Self only | ✅ |
| `/appointments` | GET/POST | AppointmentController | Self only | ✅ |
| `/appointments/{id}` | GET/DELETE | AppointmentController | Self only | ✅ |
| `/consent-forms` | ALL | ConsentFormController | Self only | ✅ |
| `/treatments` | GET/SHOW | TreatmentController | Self only | ✅ |
| `/payments` | GET/POST | PaymentController | Self only | ✅ |
| `/packages` | GET | PackageController | Self only | ✅ |

**Security Check**: ✅ All controllers enforce `client_id === user.id`

## 🔐 Middleware Validation

### Middleware Stack Analysis

| Middleware | Purpose | Roles Applied | Status |
|------------|---------|---------------|--------|
| `auth:api` | JWT Authentication | ALL | ✅ Working |
| `admin.readonly` | Read-only restriction | Admin | ✅ Blocks POST/PUT/DELETE |
| `role:provider,reception` | Role-based access | Provider, Reception | ✅ Validates role |

### Middleware Flow

```
Request → auth:api → (Role Check) → Controller → Response
                 ↓
         ┌───────┴────────┐
         ↓                ↓
    admin.readonly   role:provider,reception
    (blocks write)   (validates role)
```

**Verification**: ✅ No conflicts, proper order, all routes secured

## 🗄️ Database Isolation

### Ownership Filters Applied

#### Appointments Table
```php
// Admin: No filter (sees all)
// Provider: WHERE provider_id = user.id
// Reception: No filter (sees all)
// Client: WHERE client_id = logged_in_client.id
```

#### Clients Table
```php
// Admin: No filter (sees all)
// Provider: WHERE preferred_provider_id = user.id
// Reception: No filter (sees all)
// Client: No access (cannot view clients list)
```

#### Consent Forms Table
```php
// Admin: No filter (sees all)
// Provider: WHERE client.preferred_provider_id = user.id
// Reception: No filter (sees all)
// Client: WHERE client_id = logged_in_client.id
```

#### Payments Table
```php
// Admin: No filter (sees all)
// Provider: No filter (sees all)
// Reception: No filter (sees all)
// Client: WHERE client_id = logged_in_client.id
```

#### Treatments Table
```php
// Admin: No access (restricted)
// Provider: WHERE provider_id = user.id
// Reception: No access (restricted)
// Client: WHERE appointment.client_id = logged_in_client.id
```

**Verification**: ✅ All queries properly filtered by role

## 🚨 Conflict Detection & Resolution

### Potential Issues Identified

#### Issue 1: Appointments Table - Cross-Role Access
**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED
- Admin: View all (read-only)
- Provider: View own only
- Reception: View and manage all
- Client: Manage own only

**Resolution**: Controller-level filtering applied in `AppointmentController`

#### Issue 2: Consent Forms - Reception Access
**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED
- Reception has full CRUD on consent-forms through staff routes
- Should reception edit consent forms created by others?
- **Decision**: Reception can view/edit all (administrative override)

#### Issue 3: Inventory - Reception View Access
**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED
- Reception needs to view inventory to check product availability for appointments/billing
- Reception should NOT create/edit/delete inventory
- **Implementation**: View-only routes for reception in staff section

### Middleware Overlap Check
**Status**: ✅ NO CONFLICTS
- Admin routes: Isolated with `admin.readonly` middleware
- Staff routes: Shared by Provider and Reception with `role:provider,reception`
- Client routes: Isolated with general `auth:api`
- No overlapping route paths that could cause conflicts
