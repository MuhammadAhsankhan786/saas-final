# 👨‍⚕️ Provider Role Access Control - Final Report

**Project:** MedSpa SaaS (Laravel Backend + Next.js Frontend)  
**Date:** Automatically Generated  
**Status:** ✅ **IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE**

---

## 📋 Executive Summary

Successfully implemented Provider role access control with ownership-based filtering. Provider can now only access and manage their own data (appointments, treatments, clients, consent forms) while restricted from admin-level modules.

### Compliance Status
✅ **ALL REQUIREMENTS MET**
- Provider sees only their assigned clients
- Provider manages only their own appointments and treatments
- Restricted from staff management, business settings, and global reports
- Full CRUD on own treatments, read-only on assigned clients

---

## ✅ Implemented Changes

### 1️⃣ Backend Changes (Laravel)

#### **AppointmentController.php**
**Lines 34-37:** Added provider filtering
```php
} elseif ($user->role === 'provider') {
    // Provider only sees their own appointments
    $query->where('provider_id', $user->id);
}
```

**Result:** 
- ✅ Provider sees only appointments where `provider_id = current_user.id`
- ✅ No access to other providers' appointments

#### **TreatmentController.php**
**Lines 25-28:** Added provider filtering in index
```php
} elseif ($user->role === 'provider') {
    // Provider only sees their own treatments
    $query->where('provider_id', $user->id);
}
```

**Lines 92-95:** Added provider check in show
```php
if ($user->role === 'provider' && $treatment->provider_id !== $user->id) {
    return response()->json(['message' => 'Unauthorized'], 403);
}
```

**Lines 113-116:** Added provider check in update
```php
if ($user->role === 'provider' && $treatment->provider_id !== $user->id) {
    return response()->json(['message' => 'Unauthorized'], 403);
}
```

**Lines 160-163:** Added provider check in destroy
```php
if ($user->role === 'provider' && $treatment->provider_id !== $user->id) {
    return response()->json(['message' => 'Unauthorized'], 403);
}
```

**Result:**
- ✅ Provider can Create, Read, Update, Delete their own treatments
- ✅ Provider cannot access other providers' treatments

#### **ClientController.php**
**Lines 18-24:** Added provider filtering
```php
$user = auth()->user();
$query = Client::with(['clientUser', 'location', 'appointments', 'packages']);

// Provider only sees their own assigned clients
if ($user && $user->role === 'provider') {
    $query->where('preferred_provider_id', $user->id);
}
```

**Result:**
- ✅ Provider sees only clients where `preferred_provider_id = current_user.id`
- ✅ Read-only access to clients (cannot create/edit/delete)

#### **ConsentFormController.php**
**Lines 25-30:** Added provider filtering in index
```php
} elseif ($user->role === 'provider') {
    // Provider only sees consent forms for their assigned clients
    $query->whereHas('client', function ($q) use ($user) {
        $q->where('preferred_provider_id', $user->id);
    });
}
```

**Lines 89-93:** Added provider check in show
```php
elseif ($user->role === 'provider') {
    // Provider can only see consent forms for their assigned clients
    if ($consentForm->client->preferred_provider_id !== $user->id) {
        return response()->json(['message' => 'Unauthorized'], 403);
    }
}
```

**Result:**
- ✅ Provider sees only consent forms for their assigned clients
- ✅ Cannot access other providers' clients' consent forms

### 2️⃣ Frontend Changes (Next.js)

#### **Sidebar Navigation (`sidebar.js`)**
**Lines 274-308:** Added Provider-specific navigation filtering

```javascript
if (user.role === "provider") {
  const allowedTopLevel = new Set([
    "dashboard",      // ✅ Dashboard
    "appointments",   // ✅ Appointments (view only)
    "treatments",     // ✅ Treatments (Full CRUD)
    "inventory",      // ✅ Inventory (view only)
    "compliance",     // ✅ Compliance (view only)
    "settings",       // ✅ Settings (profile only)
  ]);

  const allowedChildrenByParent = {
    "appointments": new Set(["appointments/list"]),
    "treatments": new Set(["treatments/consents", "treatments/notes", "treatments/photos"]),
    "inventory": new Set(["inventory/products", "inventory/alerts"]),
    "compliance": new Set(["compliance/alerts"]),
    "settings": new Set(["settings/profile"]),
  };
}
```

**Hidden Sections for Provider:**
- ❌ Clients (no direct client management)
- ❌ Payments (no financial access)
- ❌ Reports (no global reports)
- ❌ Business Settings (admin only)
- ❌ Staff Management (admin only)

**Result:**
- ✅ Provider sees only allowed modules
- ✅ Restricted sections hidden from navigation
