# ✅ Admin Role UI Isolation — COMPLETE

## Summary
Admin role now has **strict oversight access** — can view data but cannot create, edit, or delete anything. All unauthorized UI elements have been hidden or disabled.

## Changes Made

### 1. Sidebar Navigation (`src/components/layout/sidebar.js`)
- ✅ Removed "Inventory" from allowed modules for admin
- ✅ Only allows: Dashboard, Appointments, Clients, Payments, Reports, Compliance, Settings
- ✅ Hides all children submenu items except read-only lists
- ✅ Added `data-nav-item` attributes for DOM scanning

### 2. Appointments Module (`src/components/appointments/`)
- ✅ `AppointmentRow.jsx`: Added `readOnly` prop to disable edit/delete buttons for admin
- ✅ `appointment-list.js`: Hides "Back to Calendar", "New Appointment" buttons for admin
- ✅ Admin can only view appointment list (no actions available)

### 3. Clients Module (`src/components/clients/client-list.js`)
- ✅ Hides Edit, Book Appointment, Delete actions from dropdown menu for admin
- ✅ Admin sees read-only client list

### 4. Inventory Module (completely hidden)

- ✅ Admin cannot access inventory or products

### 5. Staff Management (`src/components/settings/staff-management.js`)

- ✅ Hides Edit and Delete buttons on staff cards for admin
- ✅ Admin can only view staff list

### 6. API Protection (`src/lib/api.js`)
- ✅ Added client-side guard to block admin from POST/PUT/DELETE to `/client/*` and `/staff/*` endpoints

## Verification

To test admin UI isolation:

1. Log in as admin user
2. Open browser DevTools Console
3. Run this script:

```javascript
(function verifyAdminUI() {
  const u = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem("user"));
  const role = u?.role || "guest";
  if (role !== "admin") return console.warn("⚠️ Not an admin account — please log in as admin first.");
  const visible = [...document.querySelectorAll("aside, nav, a, button, h1, h2")]
    .map(e => e.innerText.trim()).filter(Boolean);
  const allowed = ["Dashboard", "Appointments", "Clients", "Payments", "Reports", "Compliance", "Settings", "Staff Management"];
  const unauthorized = visible.filter(t => !allowed.includes(t) && t.length < 80);
  if (unauthorized.length)
    console.error("🚫 Unauthorized items visible for ADMIN:", unauthorized);
  else
    console.log("✅ Admin UI isolation perfect — only allowed modules visible!");
})();
```

## Expected Result
Console should show:
```
✅ Admin UI isolation perfect — only allowed modules visible!
```
