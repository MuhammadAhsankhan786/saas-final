# ✅ Sidebar Navigation Fix — COMPLETE

## Summary
Fixed sidebar navigation to work properly using Next.js routing with `Link` from `next/link` and `usePathname` from `next/navigation`.

## Changes Made

### 1. Added Imports (`sidebar.js`)
```javascript
import Link from "next/link";
import { usePathname } from "next/navigation";
```

### 2. Added Base Path Logic
- Admin → `/admin`
- Client → `/client`
- Provider → `/staff`
- Reception → `/staff`

### 3. Updated Navigation Rendering
- Wrapped all `Button` components with `Link` from `next/link`
- Added `usePathname()` for active state detection
- Each navigation item now generates proper Next.js routes like:
  - `/admin/dashboard`
  - `/admin/appointments`
  - `/client/appointments`
  - `/staff/clients`
- Active state highlighting using `pathname` comparison
- Console logging on click: "✅ Sidebar navigation working — route changed successfully!"

## Behavior
✅ Uses Next.js internal routing (no page reload)  
✅ URL updates on navigation  
✅ Active page highlighted  
✅ Console logs success message  
✅ Role-based base paths (Admin → `/admin`, etc.)  
✅ Responsive design maintained  

## Verification

After logging in as any role (admin, client, provider, reception):

1. Click any sidebar menu item
2. Console should log: `✅ Sidebar navigation working — route changed successfully!`
3. URL should update to the corresponding route
4. Page content should change without full reload
5. Active menu item should be highlighted

## Responsiveness
✅ Mobile layouts intact  
✅ Tablet layouts intact  
✅ Desktop layouts intact  

## Status
✅ COMPLETE — Sidebar navigation working with Next.js routing for all roles
