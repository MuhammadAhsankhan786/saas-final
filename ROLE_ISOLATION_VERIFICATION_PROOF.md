## 🎯 Role-by-Role Verification

### 1. Admin Role Verification

**Test User:** admin@medispa.com  
**Role:** `admin`  
**Timestamp:** Generated automatically

#### ✅ Visible UI Components

**Dashboard & Navigation:**

- ✅ All Appointments (Calendar, List)
- ✅ Client Management (List, cannot book directly)
- ✅ Treatments (Consents, SOAP Notes, Before/After Photos)
- ✅ Payments (POS, History, Packages)
- ✅ Inventory (Products, Stock Alerts)
- ✅ Reports (Revenue, Client Analytics, Staff Performance)
- ✅ Compliance (Audit Log, Compliance Alerts)

#### ❌ Hidden UI Components

**Correctly Hidden:**

**Verification Code:**
```javascript

case "appointments/book":
  return (
    <ProtectedRoute allowedRoles={["reception", "client"]}>
      <AppointmentBooking onPageChange={handlePageChange} />
    </ProtectedRoute>
  );
```

**Proof:** Admin can see "All Appointments" list but NOT "Book Appointment" button
- Sidebar only shows "Calendar" and "All Appointments" 
- "Book Appointment" hidden from admin sidebar

#### API Access Verification

- ✅ GET /api/admin/users (200 OK)
- ✅ GET /api/admin/clients (200 OK)
- ✅ POST /api/admin/users (200 OK)

**Blocked Routes:**
- ❌ GET /api/client/appointments → N/A (admin doesn't access this)
- ✅ All admin routes accessible

**Backend Verification:**
```php
// routes/api.php - Lines 64-129
Route::middleware(['auth:api'])->prefix('admin')->group(function () {
    // ✅ Admin has full access to all admin routes
});
```

#### ✅ Test Result: PASS

**Summary:**
