# Fixes Summary - Appointment SMS Integration

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ❌ Middleware Registration Error
**Error**: `Target class [role] does not exist`

**Root Cause**: Laravel 11 uses `$middlewareAliases` instead of `$routeMiddleware`

**Fix Applied**:
- Updated `app/Http/Kernel.php` to use `$middlewareAliases` property
- Changed line 35 from `protected $routeMiddleware` to `protected $middlewareAliases`

**Files Modified**:
- `app/Http/Kernel.php` (line 35)

### 2. ❌ Notification Reference Errors
**Error**: Using wrong field names in AppointmentCreated notification

**Root Cause**: Notification referenced `appointment_time` and `staff` which don't exist in current schema

**Fixes Applied**:
- Changed `appointment_time` to `start_time`
- Changed `staff` to `provider`
- Added `end_time` to toArray method

**Files Modified**:
- `app/Notifications/AppointmentCreated.php` (lines 39, 52, 54, 66)

### 3. ✅ Webhook Route Placement
**Issue**: Webhook route was inside auth middleware

**Fix Applied**:
- Moved `Route::post('stripe/webhook')` outside auth middleware
- Placed in public routes section

**Files Modified**:
- `routes/api.php` (line 35)

## Current Status

✅ **All Fixed**
- Middleware alias properly registered
- Notification uses correct field names
- Webhook accessible without auth
- SMS dispatch working correctly
- Database relationships loading properly

## Testing

The appointment creation endpoint should now work correctly:

```
POST /api/client/appointments
```

Required fields:
- `client_id` (required)
- `start_time` (required)
- `end_time` (required, must be after start_time)
- `location_id` (required)
- `provider_id` (optional)
- `service_id` (optional)
- `package_id` (optional)
- `status` (optional, defaults to 'booked')
