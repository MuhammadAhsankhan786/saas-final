# POS Buttons Routing Verification

## Current Implementation ✅

### Button 1: "View Receipts"
- **Route**: `payments/receipts`
- **Component**: `Receipts` component
- **Shows**: Only completed payments (receipts)
- **Actions**: Download Receipt, Refund
- **Code Location**: `payment-pos.js` line 452

### Button 2: "Transaction History"  
- **Route**: `payments/history`
- **Component**: `PaymentHistory` component
- **Shows**: All payment transactions (all statuses)
- **Actions**: View Details, Download Receipt, Refund
- **Code Location**: `payment-pos.js` line 464

## Routing Setup ✅

### In `page.js`:
```javascript
case "payments/history":
  return <PaymentHistory onPageChange={handlePageChange} />

case "payments/receipts":
  return <Receipts onPageChange={handlePageChange} />
```

## Differences:

| Feature | Receipts Page | Payment History Page |
|---------|--------------|---------------------|
| **Route** | `payments/receipts` | `payments/history` |
| **Component** | Receipts | PaymentHistory |
| **Data Filter** | Only `status: 'completed'` | All statuses |
| **Default Filter** | Completed only | All statuses |
| **Title** | "View Receipts" | "Payment History" |
| **Actions** | Download, Refund | View, Download, Refund |
| **Access** | Admin, Reception | Admin, Reception, Client |

## Status: ✅ **BOTH BUTTONS WORKING CORRECTLY**

- View Receipts → Receipts component (completed payments)
- Transaction History → PaymentHistory component (all transactions)

Both buttons navigate to different routes and show different content as intended.
