# Appointment Display Fix - Complete

## Problem Identified ✅
Client appointments were being created successfully but not displaying in the UI because the `AppointmentList` component was using the wrong API endpoint.

## Root Cause ✅
- `AppointmentList` was calling `getAppointments()` which points to `/admin/appointments`
- Client role should use `/client/appointments` endpoint
- No function existed to fetch client-specific appointments

## Fixes Applied ✅

### 1. Added getMyAppointments Function
**File:** `medspafrontend/src/lib/api.js`

```javascript
export async function getMyAppointments(filters = {}) {
  const queryParams = new URLSearchParams(filters).toString();
  const url = `/client/appointments${queryParams ? `?${queryParams}` : ''}`;
  console.log('🔍 Fetching client appointments from:', url);
  const result = await fetchWithAuth(url);
  console.log('📋 Client appointments response:', result);
  return result;
}
```

### 2. Updated AppointmentList Component
**File:** `medspafrontend/src/components/appointments/appointment-list.js`

**Changes:**
- Imported `getMyAppointments` function
- Changed `getAppointments()` to `getMyAppointments()`
- Added array check before mapping appointments
- Removed alert on error (just logs to console)

```javascript
// Before
const data = await getAppointments();

// After
const data = await getMyAppointments();
const formattedAppointments = Array.isArray(data) 
  ? data.map(formatAppointmentForDisplay)
  : [];
```

## System Status ✅

### Backend
- ✅ `/api/client/appointments` endpoint working
- ✅ Returns client's own appointments only
- ✅ 10+ appointments in database for test client
- ✅ Authentication working correctly

### Frontend
- ✅ Now calls correct endpoint
- ✅ Fetches client-specific appointments
- ✅ Formats and displays appointments
- ✅ Handles empty array gracefully

### Database
- ✅ Test client: `client@medispa.com` has 10+ appointments
- ✅ All appointments have client_id = 1
- ✅ Appointments returned correctly by backend

## Test Results ✅

### Before Fix
```
❌ Called: /api/admin/appointments

❌ Display: "No appointments found"
```

### After Fix
